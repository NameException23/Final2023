Not much to say about me here. Just a nobody learning about front-end web development from NYU. Armed with a ton of knowledge, but sadly, with the capacity to comprehend only the most basic elements of HTML, CSS and very limited JavaScript, I managed to piece this humble site together. 

I love God, family, country and the New York Yankees. <a href="mailto:no-ones-here@y1sxdfrsd-phonydomain-demo-only.com">Email me here if you know: 62, 61, 60, 714, 184, 2130, 56, 652.</a>
