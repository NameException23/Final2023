![Reggie!](../../img/reggie-jackson.jpg)

Not much to say about me here. No, I'm not Reggie. Just a nobody learning about front-end web development from NYU. Armed with a ton of knowledge, but sadly, with the capacity to comprehend only the most elementary concepts of HTML, CSS and very limited JavaScript, I managed to piece this humble site together for my final project.

<strong>I love God, family, country and the New York Yankees.</strong> I began following the Yankees in kindergarten. On our black and white, WPIX's Jerry Girard (RIP) showed a replay of Reggie dropping an easy fly ball. That was my first intro to the New York Yankees. Though he dropped the ball, at that young age I remember thinking, "Man this Reggie guy is cool." I never stopped following. Not a true historian, but for sure a true fan. Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Maris, Mantle, Whitey Ford, Berra, Howard, Thurman, Oscar Gamble, Chambliss, Reggie, Randolph, Guidry, Nettles, Jerry Mumphrey, Rizzuto, Righetti, Roy Smalley, Bucky Dent, Butch Wynegar, Goose, Bobby Murcer, Mike Pagliarulo, Alvaro Espinoza (yes, Alvaro Espinoza!), Mattingly, Winfield, Sax, Rickey, Velarde, Jimmy Key, Kevin Maas, Bernie, Pettitte, Jeter, Alfonso Soriano, Shane Spencer, Neslon, Mike Stanton, Posada, Mo, Roberto Kelly, Paul O'Neill, Knoblauch, Cone, Tino, El Duque, Boggs, Cano, Matsui, A-Rod, Giambi, Tex, Chien-Ming Wang, Joba, Hughes, Betances, Andrew Miller, Hiroki, Gary, Judge, Severino, Nestor, Cole, Chad, Clay, etc.
